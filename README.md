Backend was created with node 8.10.0 and Sqlite for database, and there could be some more global dependecies for typescript and nestjs
There is the need to setup environment variables in a .env file, I will send the details in some other communication channel
at the backend folder just run the command `npm i && npm start`
Api almost supports .xml, and the history of operations came short because I lost too much time with nestJs injectable dependecies in global injectors ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Frontend was setup with react (react-scripts needed)
`npm i && npm start`
I just couldn't resist myself to create a website like that.
You can always type help.
